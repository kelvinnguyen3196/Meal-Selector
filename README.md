<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">Meal Selector is an iOS application that can help you to pick between any amount of meals. The user inputs the meals they are having trouble deciding between and after pressing randomize the app will select a meal for you. Can also be used as a way to randomly select between many different options that are not limited to meals.</p>
